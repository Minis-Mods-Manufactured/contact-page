    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="accordion-item">
  <div class="accordion-title">What financing options are available?</div>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>We work with trusted lenders who specialize in manufactured home construction loans. Even if your credit isn’t perfect, we may still have a solution—most of our buyers do <strong>NOT</strong> have perfect credit.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FHA (Federal Housing Administration)</strong><br>
        Down Payment: As low as <strong>3.5%</strong><br>
        Great for first-time homebuyers or those with limited savings.
      </li>
      <li><strong>VA (Veterans Affairs)</strong><br>
        Down Payment: <strong>0%</strong><br>
        Available to veterans, active-duty military, and qualifying spouses.
      </li>
      <li><strong>USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture)</strong><br>
        Down Payment: <strong>0%</strong> (for eligible rural areas)<br>
        Helps buyers purchase in rural areas with low or moderate income.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Conventional Loans</strong><br>
        Down Payment: Typically <strong>5%–20%</strong><br>
        Offers more flexibility and competitive long-term terms.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
    
<div class="accordion-item">
  <div class="accordion-title">What types of home loans are available?</div>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chattel Loan (Home-Only)</strong><br>
        Down Payment: Typically <strong>5%–10%</strong><br>
        For the home only—not the land. Ideal for leased land, family land, or land you already own.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Land/Home Package Loan</strong><br>
        Down Payment: Varies<br>
        Combines the home, land, and site work into one bundled loan with long-term financing.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Land-in-Lieu</strong><br>
        Down Payment: <strong>0%</strong> (if land equity qualifies)<br>
        Uses land you already own instead of a cash down payment. Land must meet lender requirements.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-title">Can I tour a home before I apply?</div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Absolutely! In fact, I encourage it. Let's schedule a VIP tour to walk through homes, ask questions, and explore all the features in person.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-title">How do I start the home buying process?</div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>It all starts with touring our homes. Once we find your dream home, we'll complete an application and get you linked up with our lenders.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-title">Can I place a home on my own land?</div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Yes! Many of our buyers place homes on private land. I can help walk you through the process.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-title">Do you have land/home packages?</div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Yes, we do! While we don’t have homes already set up on land, we help you build a custom package that includes the home, land, and all necessary site work. We believe you should have the freedom to choose where you want to live—that’s why we don’t pre-place homes on land. Most customers pick their home first, then we help with financing and finding land that fits your needs and budget.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <div class="accordion-title">How much money do I need to get started?</div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>It's free to apply! Once we get your approval back from the bank, the dealer will require a $1000 deposit to hold a home/order one. Down payment requirements will vary and depend on your credit and lender program. We’ll guide you through your options!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
<div class="accordion-item">
  <div class="accordion-title">Will applying for financing hurt my credit?</div>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>Not the way you might think! When you’re shopping for a mortgage, credit bureaus expect you to compare lenders. All mortgage credit checks done within a <strong>45-day window</strong> count as <strong>just one inquiry</strong> on your credit report.</p>
    <p>The score impact is usually minimal — often just a few points — and the long-term savings from getting a better rate far outweigh that dip. Knowing your credit position early also helps us match you with the right lenders and programs from the start.</p>
    <p><em>“I don’t want to pull my credit yet”</em> is a common worry, but applying gives you real buying power and clarity — without locking you into anything.</p>
